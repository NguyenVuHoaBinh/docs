__ Load balancing is a component that help distribute incoming request and traffic evenly across multiple servers.
__ The main goal of load balancing is to ensure High Availability, Reliability, and Performance by avoiding overloading a single server and avoiding down time.

__ To utilize full scalability and redundancy, we can try to balance the load at each layer of the system. We can add LBs at three places:
	1. User vs Web server
	2. Web Server vs Internal Platform Layer
	3. Internal Platform Layer vs Database

I. Key terminology & Concepts
1. Load Balancer: A device or software that distributes network traffic across multiple servers based on predefined rules or algorithms.
2. Back-end Servers: The servers that receive and process requests forwarded by the load balancer.
3. Load Balancing Algorithm: The method used by the load balancer to determine how distribute incoming traffic among the back-end servers.
4. Health Checks: Periodic tests performed by the load balancer to determine the availability and performance of back-end servers. Unhealthy servers are removed from the server pool until they recover.
5. Session Persistence: A technique used to ensure that subsequent request from the same client are directed to the same back-end server, maintaining session state and providing a consistent user experience.
6. [[SSL & TLS]] Termination: The process of decrypting SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic at the load balancer level, offloading the decryption burden from back end servers and allowing for centralized SSL/TLS management

II. How Load Balancer works?
__ Load balancer work by distributing incoming network traffic across multiple serves or resources to ensure efficient utilization of computing resources and prevent overload.
__General step
1. The load balancer receives a request form a client or user.
2. The load balancer evaluates the incoming request and determines which server or resources should handle the request, done by predefined load-balancing algorithm.
3. The load balancer forwards the incoming traffic to the selected server or resource.
4. The load balancer receives the response form the server or resource and sends it to the client or user who made the request.
